The assignment was to find the # of songs release in 1981 and the top 20 songs by playcount from the csv library (https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html)

solution.py
I was able to get the number of songs in 1981 using python, but I haven't figured out how to use the built-in sorted() function: https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting 

solution_pandas.py
I finally used pandas to do both parts of the assignment. 

NOTE: I still have not dealt with the near dupes. There are rows of the same song and different play counts! Need to figure out how to concatenate them.
